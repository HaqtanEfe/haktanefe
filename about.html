			<h1 id="ExampleText">About Me!</h1>
			<p>My name is Haktan. I am a 16 year old boy that is interested in computers.<br>
				I mainly focus on software part of the computers rather than hardware but it looks interesting so who knows ? Maybe I will be interested in hardware someday.<br>
				I like playing games (mainly FPS and Puzzle type of games), programming (as you might have guessed), chatting and more. If you want to talk to me, why are you waiting ?<br>
				Just shoot me a dm and we can talk about anything! Some stuff about my past, I become interested about computers in 2017 when I was 9 years old.<br>
				Of course, it wasn't like I could develop games or something, it was mainly small projects. In 2021, I started to do commisions in Roblox in order to get a few robux.<br>
				That "just a few robux" became thousands and now I believe I can do this side hustle as a real job when I become old enough. I am currently working on learning new<br>
				programming languages and improving myself. Current programming languages I know are lua, python, a little bit of html, a little bit of javascript and a little bit of C#.<br>
				<br>
				So yeah, you know about me! Now shoot me a dm and tell me about yourself :)</p>
